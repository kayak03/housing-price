# housing-price
This is the end-to-end data science project that is broken down to two main pieces. 

The first part is using a regression analysis to predict the value of houses. The dependent variable for this analysis is the price of the house and the independent variables are many different characteristics of the home, such as size, location, bedrooms, bathrooms, etc. 

The second part is using a classification analysis to determine what zip-code a house is likely located in based upon its features. The attributes used in this classification analysis consist of different characteristics of the home, such as size, location, bedrooms, and price.
